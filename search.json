It uses both bar charts and line graphs to present four key metrics from 2017 to 2022, with dual Y-axes to show dollar amounts on the left and percentages on the right. While the color coding and use of dual axes are strengths, the chart is overly complex with overlapping bars and inconsistent time intervals, making it harder to interpret. Separating the data into two charts—one for absolute values (Loan Loss Reserves and NPLs) and one for percentage trends—would improve clarity.\n1 + 1"
